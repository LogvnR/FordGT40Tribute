                            <p class="ferrari-overlay-content-text-info">In 1962, Ford was coming out of a major
                                sales
                                slide
                                thanks to failed products like the Edsel and the growing popularity of rival
                                products
                                from GM
                                and Chrysler. CEO Henry Ford II, the eldest son of Edsel Ford and eldest grandson of
                                Henry Ford,
                                was desperately looking for a way to turn the tide. Top executives, including Ford
                                Division
                                general manager Lee Iacocca, convinced him that the answer was a sports car. <br>
                                <br>
                                There was just one problem: Ford didn’t have a sports car in its portfolio, and
                                there
                                were no
                                plans to build one.<br>
                                <br>
                                It was decided that the most expedient way to bring a vehicle to market would be to
                                acquire one.
                                That’s when the idea was floated to purchase Ferrari, which in those years was
                                primarily
                                a race
                                car company that sold street-legal machines only to fund its track exploits.<br>
                                <br>
                                In the spring of 1963, after months of negotiation, an agreement seemed to be near.
                                Ford
                                would
                                pay millions to Enzo Ferrari for his company and all its assets. A former racer,
                                Enzo
                                was
                                supposedly eager to put a deal together with Ford, a move that would relieve him of
                                the
                                burden
                                of running the company day-to-day. <br>
                                <br>
                                But at the eleventh hour, Ferrari balked at a clause in the
                                contract that said Ford would control the budget and, thus, all the decisions
                                governing
                                the
                                Ferrari racing team. Enzo was unwilling to relinquish control of his company’s
                                motorsports
                                program. He told Ford’s representatives that he’d never sell under those terms—nor,
                                he
                                added,
                                would he sell to an ugly company that builds ugly cars in an ugly factory. It is
                                rumored
                                that he
                                also insulted Henry II personally by insinuating that he couldn’t hold a candle to
                                his
                                grandfather, the real Henry Ford.<br>
                                <br>
                                To add even more insult to injury, Enzo then turned around and sold a majority stake
                                in
                                Ferrari
                                to fellow Italian automaker Fiat. Some Ford executives, including the Deuce,
                                speculated
                                that
                                Enzo was never serious about selling to Ford at all but had only negotiated with the
                                company in
                                order to pressure Fiat to come up in price. The ploy worked, and Henry II was left
                                looking like
                                a fool—without a ride.<br>
                                <br>
                                Enzo cut the deal off out of spite and Henry Ford II, enraged, decided to build a
                                sports
                                car
                                that would humiliate Ferrari where it mattered to him the most, the 24 Hours of Le
                                Mans.
                                The
                                seeds for the legendary GT40 race car were sowed.

                            <p class="development-overlay-content-text-info">Initially, the task of building the
                                so-called
                                Ferrari Killer was assigned to Ford’s Advanced Vehicles Group in the United Kingdom.
                                Ford began
                                negotiation with Lotus, Lola, and Cooper. Cooper had no experience in GT or
                                prototype
                                and its
                                performances in Formula One were declining. <br>
                                <br>
                                The Lola proposal was chosen since Lola had used a Ford V8 engine in its mid-engined
                                Lola Mk6.
                                It was one of the most advanced racing cars of the time, and made a
                                noted performance in Le Mans 1963, even though the car did not finish, due to low
                                gearing and
                                slow revving out on the Mulsanne Straight. However, Eric Broadley, Lola Cars' owner
                                and
                                chief
                                designer, agreed on a short-term personal contribution to the project without
                                involving
                                Lola
                                Cars. <br>
                                <br>
                                The agreement with Broadley included a one-year collaboration between Ford and
                                Broadley,
                                and the
                                sale of the two Lola Mk 6 chassis builds to Ford. To form the development team, Ford
                                also hired
                                the ex-Aston Martin team manager John Wyer.<br>
                                <br>
                                Ford Motor Co. engineer Roy Lunn was sent to England; he had designed the
                                mid-engined
                                Mustang I
                                concept car powered by a 1.7-liter V4. Despite the small engine of the Mustang I,
                                Lunn
                                was the
                                only Dearborn engineer to have some experience with a mid-engined car.<br>
                                <br>
                                Overseen by Harley Copp, the team of Broadley, Lunn, and Wyer began working on the
                                new
                                car at
                                the Lola Factory in Bromley. At the end of 1963, the team moved to Slough, near
                                Heathrow
                                Airport. Ford then established Ford Advanced Vehicles Ltd, a new subsidiary under
                                the
                                direction of Wyer, to manage the project.<br>
                                <br>
                                The first chassis built by Abbey Panels of Coventry was delivered on 16 March 1964,
                                with
                                fiber-glass moldings produced by FibreGlass Engineering Ltd of Farnham. <br>
                                <br>
                                While the first batch of GT40s to roll out of the Advance Vehicle Group were fast,
                                they
                                were
                                also incredibly unstable and unreliable. And the brakes were downright
                                dangerous.<br>
                                <br>
                                According to Popular Mechanics, Ford engineers calculated that when a driver hit the
                                brakes at
                                the end of Le Mans’ Mulsanne Straight, the front brake rotors would heat up to 1,500
                                degrees
                                Fahrenheit within seconds, causing them to fail. This would prove to be
                                disastrous—even
                                deadly—for any driver trying to compete in northwestern France, even the best in the
                                world.<br>
                                <br>
                                Ultimately, the Ford team couldn’t figure out how to make the cars stay firmly on
                                the
                                tarmac,
                                let alone run continuously for 24 hours, two musts for a win in Le Mans. After
                                losing to
                                Ferrari
                                at Le Mans in 1964 and 1965, Ford turned to the legendary Los Angeles car designer
                                Carroll
                                Shelby, one of the only American drivers to ever win at Le Mans, to run race
                                operations.
                                Shelby
                                was already a consultant on the project, but now he was in charge, responsible for
                                its
                                success
                                or failure.<br>
                                <br>
                                After a challenging start, Shelby and his go-to test driver and engineering
                                specialist
                                Ken
                                Miles, reinvented the GT40. And they did so by collaborating with Advanced Vehicle
                                Group
                                and
                                Ford’s experimental engine group, rather than starting from scratch.<br>
                                <br>
                                Shelby and Miles first improved the handling and stability of the vehicle by
                                improving
                                its
                                aerodynamics through flow testing. They taped wool streamers or tufts to the
                                exterior of
                                the car
                                to see how air traveled over and around the vehicle. If the yarn lay flat, all was
                                good.
                                If not,
                                it indicated there were flaws in the car’s design that adversely affected downforce
                                and
                                stability. The data collected allowed Miles and Shelby to make body and suspension
                                modifications
                                that helped the GT40 be more stable and maneuverable on the track.<br>
                                <br>
                                The brake problem was solved by Phil Remington, an engineer on the Ford team. He
                                devised
                                a
                                quick-change brake system that allowed the mechanics to swap in new pads and rotors
                                during a
                                driver change, so the team didn’t have to worry about making the brakes last the
                                entire
                                race.<br>
                                <br>
                                To address reliability issues, the team put the engine on a dyno, and programmed it
                                to
                                re-create
                                the various stress points at Le Mans. Then the team ran the engine for 24 to 48
                                hours on
                                the
                                dyno, virtually re-creating the conditions the engine would face during the race so
                                it
                                wouldn’t
                                break down before the finish line.

                            <p class="lemans-overlay-content-text-info">Shelby's first victory came on their maiden
                                race
                                with
                                the Ford program, with Ken Miles and Lloyd Ruby taking a Shelby American-entered
                                Ford
                                GT40 to
                                victory in the Daytona 2000 in February 1965. One month later Ken Miles and Bruce
                                McLaren came
                                in second overall and first in prototype class at the Sebring 12-hour race. The rest
                                of
                                the
                                season, however, was a disappointment.<br>
                                <br>

                                The experience gained in 1964 and 1965 allowed the 7-liter Mk II to dominate the
                                following year.
                                In February, the GT40 again won at Daytona. This was the first year Daytona was run
                                in
                                the 24
                                Hour format and Mk II's finished 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. In March, at the 1966 12 Hours
                                of
                                Sebring,
                                GT40s again took all three top finishes with the X-1 Roadster first, a Mk. II taking
                                second, and
                                a Mk. I in third. <br>
                                <br>
                                Then in June at the 24 Hours of Le Mans the GT40 achieved yet another victory Ford
                                didn’t just
                                defeat Ferrari at Le Mans in 1966, it humiliated the Italian stallions. While
                                Ferrari
                                didn’t
                                even have a car that completed the race, GT40 Mk. II’s captured first, second and
                                third
                                places.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The finish wasn’t without controversy. Late in the race, Miles was well ahead of the
                                competition, on his way to ending Ferrari’s dominance at Le Mans and becoming the
                                only
                                driver to
                                win the world’s three biggest endurance race—the 24 hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of
                                Sebring and 24
                                Hours of Le Mans—in the same year. <br>
                                <br>
                                Ford’s PR guru Leo Beebe wanted to celebrate the win with a picture of the trio
                                crossing
                                the
                                finish line together. So, he had Shelby order Miles to slow down and let the other
                                GT40
                                teams
                                catch up. After crossing the line, Miles was informed that he did not win the race.
                                His
                                teammate
                                Bruce McLaren did. McLaren started several cars behind Miles. So even though Miles
                                was
                                faster
                                until the very end, McLaren actually traveled farther faster, because Miles
                                intentionally slowed
                                down.<br>
                                <br>
                                Despite this, the GT40 would go on to win the next 3 years, all with different
                                drivers.
